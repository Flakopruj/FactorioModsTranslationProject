# Factorio Translation Mods
Translations are available to modders, mainly for those who don't use the GitHub platform to distribute them.

The rule is simple:
We create a directory with the mod name (exactly as the creator uses it) and then place the ex. `pl` directory and then the translation file there.

If create first folder it:
<b>NameProject/locale/LngCode/config.cfg</b>
Ex. Ruins/locale/pl/config.cfg

And then we translate the mod from English into our own language.

Important:
Please use mod version and percent translation value if is incompleted translation.
Ex. 90% (90 lines from 100 text lines )
